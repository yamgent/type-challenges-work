/*
Implement a generic `DeepReadonly<T>` which make every parameter of an object - and its sub-objects recursively - readonly.

You can assume that we are only dealing with Objects in this challenge. Arrays, Functions, Classes and so on are no need to take into consideration. However, you can still challenge your self by covering different cases as many as possible.

For example

```ts
type X = { 
  x: { 
    a: 1
    b: 'hi'
  }
  y: 'hey'
}

type Expected = { 
  readonly x: { 
    readonly a: 1
    readonly b: 'hi'
  }
  readonly y: 'hey' 
}

type Todo = DeepReadonly<X> // should be same as `Expected`
```
*/

/* ----- Your Answer (START) ----- */

// Function is in the same group as `object`, hence we need to differentiate
// between Function and `object` (our dictionary object).
type DeepReadonly<T> = T extends Function 
  ? T 
  : T extends (Record<any, any> | any[])
    ? {
      readonly [key in keyof T]: DeepReadonly<T[key]>
    }
    : T

import type { Equal, Expect } from '@type-challenges/utils'

type cases = [
  Expect<Equal<DeepReadonly<X>, Expected>>,
]

type X = {
  a: () => 22
  b: string
  c: {
    d: boolean
    e: {
      g: {
        h: {
          i: true
          j: 'string'
        }
        k: 'hello'
      }
      l: [
        'hi',
        {
          m: ['hey']
        },
      ]
    }
  }
}

type Expected = {
  readonly a: () => 22
  readonly b: string
  readonly c: {
    readonly d: boolean
    readonly e: {
      readonly g: {
        readonly h: {
          readonly i: true
          readonly j: 'string'
        }
        readonly k: 'hello'
      }
      readonly l: readonly [
        'hi',
        {
          readonly m: readonly ['hey']
